A comprehensive website for tourist information about the city of Bristol in the UK. A parallax effect has been added to the website with a fixed navbar for easy navigation. The parallax images are of landmarks in Bristol. The home page is one large picture of man walking through Bristol City centre. Scrolling down the page there is an about section, an attractions section, a shopping section and a contact form for the website. The purpose of the website is to give important information to visitors of the city of Bristol and for the user to be able to know what they can do through a few day stay. 

For a user of a tourist site, they want to feel warm and welcomed and have all necessary information for a short trip to the city. A user will want to feel the vibrancy and colour of the city they are visiting. This is achieved with the parallax pictures and the colour scheme of the website, which is modern, warm and inviting. Having attractions and shopping are majorly important to the user knowing they can have a great time while in the city. The section options available make it easy to find anything and everything a user needs. 

The business goals of this website are as follows:
