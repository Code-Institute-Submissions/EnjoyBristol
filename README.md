A comprehensive website for tourist information about the city of Bristol in the UK. A parallax effect has been added to the website with a fixed navbar for easy navigation. The parallax images are of landmarks in Bristol. The home page is one large picture of man walking through Bristol City centre. Scrolling down the page there is an about section, an attractions section, a shopping section and a contact form for the website. The purpose of the website is to give important information to visitors of the city of Bristol and for the user to be able to know what they can do through a few day stay. 

For a user of a tourist site, they want to feel warm and welcomed and have all necessary information for a short trip to the city. A user will want to feel the vibrancy and colour of the city they are visiting. This is achieved with the parallax pictures and the colour scheme of the website, which is modern, warm and inviting. Having attractions and shopping are majorly important to the user knowing they can have a great time while in the city. The section options available make it easy to find anything and everything a user needs. 

The business goals of this website are as follows:

* Build trust with the user and let them feel the vibrancy of the city when the user first access's the page
* Show important information on the city's activities
* Show the best places available for users to stay in the city
* High quality UX to keep the user interested in the site
* Ensure layout is simple and efficient to use 

The user goals of the website are as follows:

* Feel they can trust the website that is offering advice
* To have clear options for activities in the city
* Ensure they can access information in the city easily
* Feel their needs are being met by the service provider

## Features

The entire website is one scrolling parallax effect. Therefore there are no need for separate pages. This means that to use the site more efficiently the navigation bar the top of the page was made sticky. This means that wherever you scroll or click on the page, then the navigation bar moves with it and stays at the top. In the scrolling page, their is a hero image on the front page, and images between each other page, which are at a height of 50%, so there is less scrolling time of the site visitor. There are four sections to the page in total. A home page, attraction page, shopping page and a contact page. There is also a footer, where the social link icons are and copyright information. 

#### Home

The Home page features one large photography covering the entire page. The name of the company also appears as a header and there is no logo used for the site. 

#### Attractions

The attractions page has four clickable buttons on the left side of the page. Navigation menu is sticky at the top of the page. These buttons are labelled as Restaurants, Bars & Clubs, Places to Stay and Family Attractions. There is a google maps on the right side of the page. When the buttons are clicked, they bring up the top ten of each topic according to tripadvisor.co.uk, which is a trusted review site. Markers appear on the map with each button clicked and they clear when another button is clicked. If you then click the marker on the map an info window pops up with the attraction name and a short description. There is a short paragraph under the section title to explain how to use the buttons and what they do for the user.

#### Shopping

Between the Attractions section and the shopping section there is a parallax effect with a new picture. Navigation menu is again sticky at the top of the page. The shopping section consists of six different photographs of shopping area in Bristol. Each of these photographs is clickable and opens an external page directly to the corresponding shopping area website. There is a short paragraph under the section title to explain how to use the photographs and what they do for the user.   

#### Contact Us

Once again there is a picture between Shopping section and Contact Us section using the parallax effect. The navigation is again at the top as always. This is just a simple form with a call to action button at the bottom to allow a potential client to send through their query to the service provider. There is a name, email and message section for the form. The form is fully functional and email will be sent to site owner. 

#### Footer

In the footer is copyright information and links to the social media sites.

#### Possible Future Features

* GDPR compliant pop up screen. 
* A local weather section.
* Blog from people living in the city.
